Analyze and optimize performance:

1. Profile current implementation
2. Identify bottlenecks (O(nÂ²) loops, etc.)
3. Suggest algorithmic improvements
4. Add caching where appropriate
5. Optimize database queries
6. Reduce memory allocations
7. Consider async/parallel processing

Provide benchmarks showing before/after metrics.
Target: 50% performance improvement
