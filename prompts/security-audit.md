1. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. Identify hardcoded secrets or API keys
3. Review authentication/authorization logic
4. Scan for XSS vulnerabilities
5. Check for insecure dependencies
6. Review encryption and hashing methods
7. Identify potential CSRF issues

For each issue found:
- Explain the vulnerability
- Show how to fix it
- Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
